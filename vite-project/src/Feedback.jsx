    <p className='feedback'>As a beginner I started learning React in 2024 and I have never really progressed since then as I found it too complex to move on to intermediate concepts. But the following sessions were very helpful and made React, easier for me and engaging to learn. Looking forward to learn more in upcoming sessions too!!</p>
